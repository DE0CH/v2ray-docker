            NAT Is Good, I hope it still exists for IPv6
          </a>
        </h3><p>I used to hate Network Translation Layer (NAT) because it made hosting anything so much more complicated. It also makes devices waste a lot of power because they have to constantly poll a server to receive push notifications. IPv6 is supposed to address this problem so decided to experiment with it. Although the experiment failed (I still mostly use IPv4), I began to see several huge advantages of NAT.</p>

            Why I Use Windows on Desktop Rather than Linux
          </a>
        </h3><p>I love using Linux on servers. I run web servers, write code, and do experiments with interesting projects using Linux (specifically Debian and Ubuntu). This blog post explains why I don’t use Linux on desktop.</p>

            Sunk Cost Fallacy and My Struggle with It
          </a>
        </h3><p>I went to have a driving test a few days ago and I failed because of one simple mistake — moving off without giving way. I was quite devastated because I had spent 40 hours plus thousands of pounds taking driving lessons. Rationally, that is just the sunk cost and should be ignored but I still feel very upset and even lost sleep because of it. That made me reflect on why I experienced this.</p>

            To update or not to update, that is the question
          </a>
        </h3><p>Picking up a coding project that I haven’t touched for a year or two, I have come to expect that nothing about it still works and I need to update all of its components and my code to get it to work again. I didn’t realize how strange this was until I compared it to other things. If I leave a book unattended for many years, it won’t just fall apart for no reason and if I pick up my camera after a few years, it will still take pictures.</p>

        </h3><p>No one nowadays buys a generator to generate electricity; rather, we buy it as a finished product from power plants delivered through the grid, but why is it that people still buy computers instead of buying the finished product, which is computing power delivered through the internet?</p>
